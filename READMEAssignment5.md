# Dress to Impress Assignment 5

## Index (Home Page)
This was one of the first pages I created for the Dress to Impress Website. It includes two hero images that showcase links to our outfit generator and editorial page, along with a navigation bar to all the other pages if the user wants to go straight to something like the weather. 
## Weather
This page is used for the user to research weather based data on our website. This page is where I implemented both of my APIs and also includes a link to the weather channel’s website for the user's daily weather forecast. The APIs that I chose to implement on this page were GetWeatherByType and GetTemperature. GetWeatherByType takes an input of WeatherID and displays that information according to the ID (Sunny, Rainy, etc.). GetTemperature also takes an input of WeatherID and displays that information according to the ID (25℃, etc.). The Weather Page is composed of three hero images each with a button. The first two which take API information and display the results after user input, and the last which houses the link to the weather forecast.

## Inventory (AllClothing)
Our “Inventory” page is designed to be able to show all of the looks that the database currently has that have been entered by either web designers or businesses adding their own looks.  The inventory page integrates our database by showing each outfit as it comes into the website.  
## Outfit Results 
The Outfit Results page on our website comes with many features inside the page.  First, there is a function that allows the user to go to the inventory page to see all the inventory inside the website.  Next, this page allows the user to be able to generate different outfits based on the season.  This function utilizes javascript to be able to generate outfits that are in the specific season that the user wants (designed originally by Rylee Norman).  The last functionality of this website uses an API to get the specific user occupation to better prepare users for the weather including their occupation.  By adding the occupation, the user is able to see how both their day to day life while being prepared for the weather. Under User Occupation, there is a second integrated API that allows the user to be able to search for the season of a piece of clothing based on the identification number. 
## Photo Uploader 
In our photo uploader, users and businesses alike are able to upload photos of their outfits that are able to be sold on the website.  With the photo uploader, our website is able to gain monetary contributions with more outfits being added to the database. 
## Listing 
Using an OutfitCRUD, our website is able to add listings to the website directly when the user inputs them.  In our listing, the user is able to add a unique identification number to the item, the item type, color, and price.  This listing page goes hand in hand with the photo uploader page to add a photo of their item after listing it on the website.
